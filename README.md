# README Generator

  ## Description

  The README is an important part of every project, so I created this application to save time on creating the README in order to have more time for the "meat" of your project. This application receives your answers to the questions and produces a professional looking README for you to include in your repository.

  ## Usage

  1. Type the command "node index.js" in order to start the application. 
  2. Answer each of the questions and select the license you are using for your project. Include your GitHub username as well as your email address for others to be able to contact you. A README template will be created that you can further edit should you choose to do so.
